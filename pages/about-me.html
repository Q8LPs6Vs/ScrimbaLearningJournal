                <h1>Hi there! My name is Roku and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                    Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get
                    expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                    like-minded peers.</p>
                <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
                <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend
                    hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects
                    using what I learned or work new techniques into existing
                    projects.</p>
                <p>While it was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
                was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I
                    would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning
                    session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own
                    words.</p>
                <p>That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that
                    posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and
                    stay motivated.</p>
